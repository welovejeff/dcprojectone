DC Project One: A Creative Hub Idea
The Official Wiki for DC Project One.
 

DC Project One is an idea thought up by Jeff MacDonald. To put it best Project One is going to be a community center built in Washington, DC. A more wordy explanation would be that the Project is a cafe / art gallery / community outreach/action center / film, music, art, design, and culture lab / school / film and t.v. studio production space / equipment borrow or rent /  poetry, prose, and plays / live music venue / recording studio / And creative library.

This project initially thought up by Jeff as an idea called HQ on April 8th 2006 at the Star Bucks in Springfield, Ill. The hope is by creating wiki in which people can become involved this idea may take off and become a reality. This  will be a user created space and a center in which everyone's voice is heard. Thank you and get editing.
 

The 5 W's & 1 H Answered
------------------------

-   ### Who? 

    -   Who is involved and who will benefit? The answer is the community at large and YOU. This project is meant for everyone to have a space to learn and create. That's why it's starting with a wiki. From after school programs to refresher workshops for creative professionals. We want to leave no one without the opportunity to be all that they can be. This is a sanctuary for creative individuals. And a tool for the community-at-large. Finally we will provide a space for free thinking and progressive action that can illicit a response from the community. A site people will actually want to visit and interact in.
-   ### What?

    -   That introduction gave you an idea about what the overall objective of the project is. To see inspirations for the project look above. But it's up to everyone to elaborate on the exact resources included in the creative space.
-   ### Why?

    -   We need this. Plain and simple the community of DC would benefit from a center with so many resources. I think it's in everyones interest to make this dream a reality.

-   ### Where?

    -   In DC of course. Preferably in a area that needs this kind of service, and is accessible to the public fairly easily. But this project could be placed in any location where a community could benefits from it's addition. Any city could start up a Project One wiki and we could all help out eachother as a network.
    -   After living in Richmond for sometime now I've come to realize that this could also be a great place for this project.  There are a dozen stories of graduates of VCU starting independent stores and gallaries. I believe this is because rent is much cheaper here and their is a built in audience for these kinds of projects. So Maybe this would be a great place to start and then open in DC in the future. Give your opinions in the wiki.

-   ### When?

    -   Good Question. It will take time but hopefully with everyones help and enthusiasm we can make something that will last and help lots of people in the process.

-   ### How?

    -   There are lots of possibilities on how to execute this project. One of the largest problems with something this large is funding. Since this is a public service being created there is a large amount of grant money available. [Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100206045904/http://www.upo.org/uponetwork.html) is a list of Programs that [the DC Community action agency](https://web.archive.org/web/20100206045904/http://www.upo.org/) carries out, we might one day want to partner with this group to provide a place of forum for the citizens of DC and provide a cool establisment for their after school programs. Also the project should steer away from high interest bank loans and accept small donations or take loans from individuals like [prosper](https://web.archive.org/web/20100206045904/http://www.prosper.com/) or [zopa](https://web.archive.org/web/20100206045904/http://www.zopa.com/). Since this is such an innovative idea, yet inevitably expensive the project will most likely take many steps and "versions" before we reach the finished project.
